## Description
This is the official portfolio of Justin Barnikow. Justin Barnikow is a web developer with full-stack skills. He especially loves spending time working on front-end projects creating responsive, aesthetically pleasing and mobile-friendly apps. Justin is a proud husband and father who loves to eat great food, hike through nature and spend time learning new things.

## Motivation
Justin wanted to make a portfolio that is clean and easy to navigate through while putting his personality on display. Much of the text and images are part of slideshows so that there are plenty of details about Justin without overloading the page and distracting from the focal points. His favorite colors are typically pastels, hence the color-theme of justinbarnikow.com.
